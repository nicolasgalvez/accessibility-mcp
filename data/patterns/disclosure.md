# Disclosure (Show/Hide) Pattern

## About This Pattern

A disclosure is a widget that enables content to be either collapsed (hidden) or expanded (visible). It has two elements: a disclosure [button](../button/button-pattern.html) and a section of content whose visibility is controlled by the button. When the controlled content is hidden, the button is often styled as a typical push button with a right-pointing arrow or triangle to hint that activating the button will display additional content. When the content is visible, the arrow or triangle typically points down.
